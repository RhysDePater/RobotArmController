2. Open the coppelia sim and using the file menu open the prac scene from within the scene folder: "EGB339_robot_prac_v1.2.ttt"

3. Open Matlab and set your workspace to include subfolders to ensure the remote api files and coppeliaSim class can be seen within your current workspace.

4. Run the "EGB339_prac_example_test" live script and verify the script can connect with coppeliaSim and proceeds to set joint positions of the simulated robot

5. Congratulations, you have successfully run the EGB339 prac example, please feel free to modify the example script to interact with your robot.

6. Please be sure to include a clear all in your script so that the communication interface resets appropriately.
